<h1>Welcome to "Xerithas" revived</h1>
Yes we all know George's site was awesome, but I heard it's gone and it might not be coming back. Coy did give me George's code, but I haven't looked at it and thought this would be fun to do from scratch while I learn how to do web programming. Either way I have a long way to go to be awesome like George. You are very welcome for the bland look. Why aren't more websites this straight to the point?
<h2>Recent News</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I now use an Ordering table. It's quite nice because it's separate from the other more important reported match data. I've updated the player page to make use of this table and it helped me break up rounds. I need to go back and do it with the league page. Next on the docket will be adding the ability to allow people to adjust the ordering. This will complete the report generation features needed to calculate total ranks, per round ranks, and strength of schedule.</li>
    <li>I again lost sleep working on the website. If only I didn't have a J-O-B!</li>
</ul>
