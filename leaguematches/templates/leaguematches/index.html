<h1>Welcome to "Xerithas" revived</h1>
Yes we all know George's site was awesome, but I heard it's gone and it might not be coming back. Coy did give me George's code, but I haven't looked at it and thought this would be fun to do from scratch while I learn how to do web programming. Either way I have a long way to go to be awesome like George. You are very welcome for the bland look. Why aren't more websites this straight to the point?
<h2>Known Bugs</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Match order is broken so results will not be accurate if you play more than 5 games. Right now order is only based on round, date, and reported time.</li>
    <li>I haven't split up rounds yet</li>
    <li>I'm very bad at web programming</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features not yet implemented</h2>
<ul>
    <li>No way to input matches (or anything really). I just manually put them in myself. I wanted to get reporting up first.</li>
